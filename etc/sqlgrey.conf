## SQLgrey config file ##
#########################

# Notes: 
# - Unless specified otherwise commented settings are SQLgrey's defaults
# - SQLgrey uses a specific config file when called with -f <conf_file>

## Configuration files
# conf_dir = /etc/sqlgrey

## Log level
# Uncomment to change the log level (default is normal: 2)
# nothing: O, errors only: 0, warnings: 1, normal: 2, verbose: 3, debug: 4
# loglevel = 2

## log categories can be fine-tuned,
# here are the log messages sorted by types and levels,
# (anything over the loglevel is discarded):
#
# grey     : (0) internal errors,
#	     (2) initial connections, early reconnections,
#	         awl matches, successful reconnections, AWL additions,
#	     (3) smart decision process debug,
# whitelist: (2) whitelisted connections,
#	     (3) actual whitelist hit,
#	     (4) whitelists reloads,
# optin:     (3) optin/optout global result
#	     (4) optin/optout SQL query results
# spam     : (2) attempts never retried,
# mail     : (1) error sending mails,
#	     (4) rate-limiter debug,
# dbaccess : (0) DB errors,
#            (1) DB upgrade,
#	     (2) DB upgrade details,
# martians : (2) invalid e-mail addresses,
# perf     : (2) cleanup time,
# system   : (0) error forking,
#	     (3) forked children PIDs, children exits,
# conf     : (0) errors in config files, missing required file,
# 	     (1) warnings in config files,
#	         missing optional configuration files,
#	     (2) reloading configuration files,
# other    : (4) Startup cleanup
# you can set a level to O (capital o) to disable logs completely,
# but be aware that then SQLgrey can come back to haunt you...

# Provide a coma-separated "logtype:loglevel" string
# For example if you set the loglevel to 3 (verbose) but want SQLgrey to be:
# . quiet for whitelists
# . normal for greylisting
# uncomment the following line.
# log_override = whitelist:1,grey:2
# By default, log_override is empty

## Log identification
# by default this is the process name. If you define the following variable
# SQLgrey will use whatever you set it to
# log_ident =

## username and groupname the daemon runs as
# user = sqlgrey
# group = sqlgrey

## Socket
# On which socket do SQLgrey wait for queries
# use the following if you need to bind on a public IP address
# inet = <public_ip>:2501
# to bind on a UNIX socket, use the following:
# unix = /path/to/socket
# default :
# inet = 2501    # bind to localhost:2501

## PID
# where to store the process PID
# pidfile = /var/run/sqlgrey.pid

## Greylisting delays
# If you want to be really strict (RFC-wise) use these
# This is *not* recommended, you'll have false positives
# reconnect_delay = 15    # don't allow a reconnection before 15 minutes
# max_connect_age = 2     # don't allow a reconnection after 2 hours
# default: (based on real-life experience)
# reconnect_delay = 5
# max_connect_age = 24

## Throttling too many new entries from new host
# Setting this optional parameter will refuse an excessive number of
# new entries in the connect table from the same host, in the following
# manner:
# - If there are already "connect_src_throttle" entries in the connect
#   table from the same host (e-mails which have not been retried yet)
# - And there is NO entry for this host in domain_awl
# - And there are LESS than "connect_src_throttle" entries in the
#   from_awl table for this host
# THEN further incoming connections from this host will be (temporarily)
# refused without new entries being created in the connect table (until
# some already waiting entries have been successfully retried).
# This feature may prevent the connect table from growing too big and
# being polluted by spambots, viruses, zombie machines and the like.
# If set to "0" (default), this feature won't be used.
# connect_src_throttle = 5


## Auto whitelists settings
# default is tailored for small sites
# awl_age = 60
# group_domain_level = 2

# For bigger sites you may want
# a smaller awl_age and a bigger group_domain_level
# awl_age = 32            # (monthly newsletter will get through)
# group_domain_level = 10 # wait for 10 validated adresses to add a whole
			  # domain in AWL

## Database settings
# instead of Pg below use "mysql" for MySQL, "SQLite" for SQLite
# any DBD driver is allowed, but only the previous 3 have been tested
# db_type = Pg
# db_name = sqlgrey
# Note: the following are not used with SQLite
# db_host = localhost
# db_port = default
# db_user = sqlgrey
# db_pass = spaces_are_not_supported
# db_prepare_cache = 0 # use prepared statements cache
                       # BEWARE: memory leaks have been reported
		       # when it is active
# db_cleandelay = 1800 # in seconds, how much time between database cleanups
# clean_method = sync # sync : cleanup is done in the main process,
                      #        delaying other operations
                      # async: cleanup is done in a forked process,
                      #        it won't delay mail processing
                      #        BEWARE: lockups have been reported
                      #        and are still investigated

## Database clustering (for advanced setups)
#
# See README.DBCLUSTER
#
# Writes will be done to db_host specified above, and reads will be done
# from read_hosts specified below
#
# Valid options: on/off. If set to 'on', clustering will be enabled.
# db_cluster = on

#
# Comma seperated list of read-only db-servers.
# read_hosts= slave-db-1.test.com, slave-db-2.test.com ,slave-db-3.test.com
# read_hosts=localhost


## X-Greylist header added?
# This adds delay, whitelist and autowhitelist information in the headers
# prepend = 1

## Greylisting method:
# - full   : greylist by IP address
# - classc : greylist by class C network. eg:
#            2.3.4.6 connection accepted if 2.3.4.145 did connect earlier.
# - smart  : greylist by class C network unless there is no reverse lookup
#            or it looks like a home-user address. 
# NOTE: IPv6 addresses are treated the same way in 'classc' and 'smart':
#       First the algorithm decides whether the address is in a EUI-64 form
#       or not. If it is then the whole /64 subnet is regarded as "class C"
#       and all the hosts from that subnet are greylisted with the same
#       rule. For non-EUI-64 addresses the full address is processed.
# Default is smart
# greymethod = smart

## Optin/Optout (see README.OPTINOUT for details)
# - none   : everyone is greylisted (default)
# - optin  : one must optin to have its (incoming) messages being greylisted
# - optout : one must optout to not have its messages being greylisted
# optmethod = none

## Discriminating Greylisting (see README.DISCRIMINATION)
# - off : normal greylisting
# - on  : Only apply greylisting to senders that do not pass the regexp test.
#
# discrimination = off

# Display the number of the regular expression causing the greylisting
# at the end of the reject message.
# Values: on/off
# discrimination_add_rulenr = off

## SQLgrey return value.
# SQLgrey can tell Postfix to:
# - immediately reject a message with a temporary reject code
# - only do so if following rules would allow the message to pass
# The first choice will prevent Postfix from spending time evaluating
# potentially expensive rules.
# In some cases you may want following rules to be aware of the connection
# this.
#
# We can specify a different rejection strategy for the first connection
# attempt, and for early reconnections. 'immed' chooses immediate rejection
# 'delay' choose delayed rejection
#
# By default we use delay on first attempt
# reject_first_attempt = delay
# Default for early reconnection is the value affected to reject_first_attempt
# reject_early_reconnect = delay

# Use specific reject code - Only used if reject_first_attempt/reject_early_reconnect = immed
# (Some "odd" mailservers actually bounce on 450 but not 451)
# reject_code = 451
# reject_code = dunno

## Update server
# where to get updates for whitelists
# whitelists_host = sqlgrey.bouton.name

## Postmaster address
# who gets urgent notifications (DB is down for example)
# empty: don't send mail notifications
# default:
# admin_mail = postmaster
